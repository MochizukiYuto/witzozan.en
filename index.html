        University of Nagano Dormitory Festival:WitZozan<br>
        Hot food and drinks gather in Central Square, so you can warm up your chilled body while the band heats up the venue on stage. <br>
        R-DEPOT gathers rare props, so please drop in as a winter resort.<br>
        We haven't been able to hold it in corona for the last 2 years, but it's definitely going to be a new local community place.

      <h1><span class="headline">What is the mean of WitZozan</span></h1>
      <p>A combination of with and Zozan.<br>
        "I want you to have fun with the students of Shozan Dormitory, and it would be nice if you could connect with them." <br>
        The locals call Shozan Sakuma "Sakuma Zouzan", so at the University of Nagano, the Shozan Dormitory is called "Zouzanryo".

      <h1>What is the mean of the logo</h1>
      <p>
        The design expresses the desire to make a circle of i that connects the separated areas (broken circles) into Shozan Dormitory. <br>
        "i" has various meanings, such as "i" for information and "I" for myself.

        Nice to meet you.
        WitZozan executive committee.
        The 8 people who gathered to hold a dormitory festival are getting along well and are proceeding with the project.
        It seems that they did it 3 and 4 years ago, but they didn't take over and started from scratch.
        I think there are some things that I can't reach, but I would appreciate it if you would watch over me with warm eyes.
